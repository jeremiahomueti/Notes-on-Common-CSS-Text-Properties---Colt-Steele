Text-align is used to arrange the position of a text horizontally, right, left or center.

Font-weights is how we can control the boldness or lightness of a text.

It ranges from certain keywords to numbers.

Font-weight keywords: normal, bold, lighter, bolder, 100, 900. 

and we also have numbers...

Font-weight: 100;
Font-weight: 200;
Font-weight: 300;
Font-weight: 400; //normal
Font-weight: 500;
Font-weight: 600;
Font-weight: 700; //bold
Font-weight: 800;
Font-weight: 900;

Not all fonts respond to the above font-weights actually, more on fonts and its eccentricities a bit letter.
Sometimes the browser doesn't pick up some font numbers, but the closest enabled font for the browser to what you demanded from it.


Text decoration controls the appearance of decorative lines on text. So this is how we show underline, overline and
strikethrough.

text-decoration: underline;
text-decoration: blue overline;

We can also control the style, that is:
text-decoration: red strikethrough wavy;


Also because links by default changes the colours of hyperlinked texts into underlined blue texts, to remove that, 
we can say:

all anchor link text-decorations equal none.

a {
    text-decoration: none;
}

that's really much for text-decoration. Although you can also control the thickness of the line.


Next one is Line-Height, which controls the height of a line of text. From observation, it's really line spacing that
is called line-height. So, single spacing, 1.5 spacing, double spacing, etc.

In CSS, you have:
- Line-height: normal;
- Line-height: 2.5;
- Line-height: 3em;
- Line-height: 150%;
- Line-height: 32PX;


So, the format actually varies. According to Colt Steele, we'll get into more the different styles or formats. Actually
hope we can get through with all these soonest!! Awhhgg!!


There is also something called Letter-spacing - that is, s p a c i n g   in between texts.

For example: 

Letter-spacing: 15px;
